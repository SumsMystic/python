I am creating this Git Repo to store all my Python code that I practice. 
My practice sets usually include the following:
	1. General Python programming involving some interview problem statements or some algorithmic challenges I've come across
	2. Selenium practice code through Python with PyTest Framework, Behave Framework (and Robot Framework too in future)
	3. REST API testing practice code through Python
